# OrtegaDenseNetwork

This is an implementation for a neural network training on an MNIST model using python lists. 
Although not practical at all for real life, it was a nice exercise in combining knowledge of data structures 
and algorithms and incorporating this knowledge into the field of Machine Learning. I had a blast :) . 
Weights and Hidden layers from a fully trained Tensorflow model and fed as either weights for the model or for 
testing purposes by comparing with the outputs of the hidden layers of my Forward Propagating Neural Network. 
At a future point, including back-propagation to incorporate a fully-trainable model are not out of the picture
as it would only require backwards functionality for the 2 layer classes.
